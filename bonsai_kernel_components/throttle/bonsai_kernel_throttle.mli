(** [effect_throttle input ~effect] performs [effect value] every time the value is
    changed, but throttles the effects to be dispatched at most [wait] after they are
    resolved. The effect is performed on both the leading and trailing edge.

    Common use cases include:
    - Search inputs: Trigger API calls as users type, without overwhelming your backend
      with a request per keystroke.
    - Form validations: Run expensive validations on field changes while maintaining UI
      responsiveness.
    - Real-time filtering: Update filtered results for large datasets without re-filtering
      on every input change.
    - API rate limiting: Ensure your application respects API rate limits by controlling
      the cadence of requests. *)

(** Immediately updates the result when the value changes initially, then throttles
    subsequent updates according to the [wait] interval.

    Common use cases include:
    - Polling state rpc query rate-limiting: PSRPC eagerly polls when the query changes,
      so query throttling can reduce wasted server CPU. *)
